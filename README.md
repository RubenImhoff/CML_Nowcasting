# Rainfall Nowcasting Using Commercial Microwave Links and Radar Rainfall QPE
This repository contains the Python and R scripts that were used in the publication "Rainfall Nowcasting Using Commercial Microwave Links" by Imhoff et al. (2020a). The repository contains five main folders: 'Adjusted_pySTEPS_scripts', 'Data', 'GridPointsToGeotiff', 'Nowcasting' and 'RAINLINK_Scripts'.

The Commercial Microwave Link (CML) data is first interpolated to a 1 km2 grid that is the same as the grid of the KNMI radar rainfall data (https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:05a7abc4-8f74-43f4-b8b1-7ed7f5629a01). RAINLINK is employed for this purpose (Overeem et al., 2013, 2016). The used R-scripts of RAINLINK are present in the folder 'RAINLINK_Scripts' and all necessary (CML) data is provided in the folder 'Data' (i.e., the parameter values, the interpolation grid and the output CML data). After this interpolation step, the data is available as 15-minute rainfall intensity per grid cell location. Subsequently, the Python script in 'GridPointsToGeotiff' is used to save the data in a GeoTIFF-format that has the same grid and extent as the KNMI radar rainfall data. 

The radar and CML rainfall estimates are available on the same grid now. Probabilistic nowcasts are made with pysteps (Pulkkinen et al., 2019) with the scripts in the folder 'Nowcasting'. These scripts follow the method described in Imhoff et al. (2020b). The folder 'Adjusted_pySTEPS_scripts' contains the scripts that were adjusted, as compared to the original model configurations of pysteps (Pulkkinen et al., 2019), to allow for nowcasting with the GeoTIFF files. For the distribution of the latest pysteps version, see also https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps. 

# Used algorithms
